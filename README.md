# 📝 Chat with Tamil PDF: A RAG Implementation Using Gemini API and LangChain

Welcome to **Chat with Tamil PDF**! This is a basic implementation of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using the **Gemini API** and **LangChain**. The app lets you upload a PDF (particularly Tamil PDFs), split the content into manageable chunks, and interact with it through an intelligent chatbot powered by **Google Gemini LLM** and **FAISS indexing**. 🧠📄

## Features:
- **Upload a PDF**: Easily upload your PDF and start chatting with its contents. 📤
- **Text Chunking**: The content is split into manageable chunks using LangChain's recursive text splitter for better context retention. 🔗
- **FAISS Indexing**: The app dynamically creates and stores FAISS indexes to improve query retrieval. 🗂️
- **Google Gemini LLM**: Harness the power of Google's Generative AI for highly accurate, retrieval-based answers. 💬🤖
